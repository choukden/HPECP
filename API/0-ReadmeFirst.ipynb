        "# Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API hands-on workshop\n",
        "HPE Container Platform (HPE CP) uses **container technology** to make it simpler and more cost-effective to deploy, run and manage both cloud-native microservices enterprise workloads and non-cloud-native monolithic stateful applications for machine learning, deep learning, and big data analytics use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "This workshop focuses on how developers can interact with HPE CP programmatically through its REST API, to accelerate their application development and deployment on containers. The workshops does not cover how to perform IT administrative tasks through the REST API.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will get started with some fundamental knowledge about how to interact with the HPE Container Platform programmatically through its REST API. As tenant user, you will learn how to perform authentication, deploy cloud-native stateless applications and non-cloud-native distributed multi-node applications for AI/ML and data analytics and interpret/respond to the status of your REST API calls. We walk you through, step by step, and, by the end of the session, you'll be deploying a TensorFlow application framework and other simple applications. \n",

        "# Lab Flow\n",
        "HackShack workshops are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. We are now leveraging a jupyterhub server on which all the different labs guides will be stored in a `Jupyter Notebook` format (*.ipynb). These Notebooks are accessible from the internet for the event.\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides, the notebooks can be downloaded on to your own laptop for further usage or edition. In order to use  them, you will need to install the jupyter notebook application available [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",

        "\n",
        "In the notebook we'll primarily use `cURL` (Command-Line URL) to make REST API calls. cURL is the universal and well appreciated utility in the Linux community. You will then use `kubectl` to make K8s API calls and interact with the Kubernetes cluster in the context of your tenant user account.\n",

        "* The `Controller host` manages all the hosts that comprise the HPE Container Platform deployment.\n",
        "* The `Kubernetes (K8s) hosts` are under the direct control of the Controller host. These hosts can be grouped into one or more distinct Kubernetes clusters that run containerized applications.\n",
        "* The `Gateway host` acts as a proxy server that carries client requests (HPE CP UI, REST API, K8s API (kubectl commands)) to the HPE Container Platform controller, to one of the K8s clusters or to the containerized application services running in one of the K8s clusters. Containerized application service endpoints are exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster to users via the gateway re-mapped ports. \n",
        "* The `Authentication Proxy` handles users authentication and forwards authenticated K8s API traffic (kubectl commands) to the Kubernetes cluster master and returns any responses to the request back to the user.\n",
        "* The `HPE Data Fabric` (a MapR File System) is a storage provider for persistent volumes for the applications that require persistence of data. The default StorageClass is available out of the box from the HPE Data Fabric (MapR) using the HPE Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for MapR.\n",
