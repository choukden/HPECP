    "- *HPE Container Platform* is an enterprise-grade container platform designed to deploy both cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications whether on-premises, at the edge, in multiple public clouds, or in a hybrid model. This makes the HPE Container Platform ideal for helping enterprise customers accelerate their application development and deployment on **containers**, on-demand through a self-service portal and a RESTful API that surfaces programmable access. To learn more about HPE Container Platform visit the [HPE DEV portal](https://developer.hpe.com) and check out the blog articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *tenant:* A tenant is a group of users created by the platform administrator. A tenant can represent for example, an office location, a business unit, an organization, or a project. A tenant is allocated a quota of resources (CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and Kubernetes clusters resources) by the platform administrator. All the resources used by a tenant are not shared with other tenants. A tenant user is granted the role of member or admin for the tenant.\n"

    "* A POST request against object **/api/v2/session**, with the username/password credentials and the Tenant name in the body.\n",
    "* The session location is then used in the HTTP header of subsequent requests.\n",

    "Postman can be used to issue REST API calls to the HPE Container Platform. The following capture shows the information passed by Postman to the API. It is a **POST** operation against **/api/v2/session** to create a session object. The header specifies JSON as the exchange format and the body provides the user credentials and tenant name. The target HPE Container Platform endpoint (the gateway) IP address, the user credentials and tenant name are defined in a group of variables called a Postman *Environment*. These variables typically describe a given target environment and are expected to be set before the API calls. Postman also allows you to extract the session location from the response header and store it in a Postman environment variable for later use. This is accomplished by using a simple JavaScript code as shown in the *Tests* tab. "
