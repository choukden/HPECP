    "- *HPE Container Platform* is an enterprise-grade container platform designed to deploy both cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications whether on-premises, at the edge, in multiple public clouds, or in a hybrid model. This makes the HPE Container Platform ideal for helping enterprise customers accelerate their application development and deployment on **containers**, on-demand through a self-service portal and a RESTful API that surfaces programmable access. To learn more about HPE Container Platform visit the [HPE DEV portal](https://developer.hpe.com) and check out the blog articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *tenant:* A tenant is a group of users created by the platform administrator. A tenant can represent for example, an office location, a business unit, an organization, or a project. A tenant is allocated a quota of resources (CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and Kubernetes clusters resources) by the platform administrator. All the resources used by a tenant are not shared with other tenants. A tenant user is granted the role of member or admin for the tenant.\n"

    "## The HPE Container Platform API Reference\n",
    "The HPE CP REST API allows you to achieve multiple actions programmatically, from performing administrative tasks, creating Kubernetes clusters to deploying applications for various use cases in a shared multi-tenant environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can call the HPE Container Platform API, you need to know what calls can be placed. The REST API reference documentation describes each object type, along with the supported operations, request input parameters, response model and response codes. \n",
    "To access the REST API reference documentation, obtain the IP address or hostname of the current active HPE Container Platform controller host or Gateway host from the administrator of the platform. Then in a web browser, navigate to the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "http(s)://[Gateway-or-Controller-IP-address-fqdn]/apidocs\n",
    "```\n",
    "Accessing the HPE Container Platform API reference documentation varies depending on whether your platform has been configured to use HTTPS secure protocol or non-secure HTTP protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the REST API calls are in the form: \n",
    "``` \n",
    "An HTTP VERB such as GET , POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, UPDATE. \n",
    "\n",
    "A target API object URL: \n",
    "http(s)://[Gateway-IP-address-or-fqdn]:8080/api/v2/[object]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Session Authentication in a multi-tenant environment\n",
    "With the exception of some API calls, most of the REST API calls you can do against the HPE Container Platform API requires authentication. HPE Container Platform uses a *‘session location’* to use as operation context. In a multi-tenant environment, you request an authentication session location by issuing an authentication request in the following form:\n",
    "* Call the API to request (POST) a new login session, providing username/password credentials as well as the Tenant name in the JSON body. The user must be a valid tenant user credentials with a role (member or admin) in the requested tenant. \n",
    "* Extract the resource path of the created *session location* object from the JSON response header,\n",
    "* For each subsequent call, set a new HTTP Header with its key set to **X-BDS-SESSION** and its value set to the session location value and used as the *working tenant* context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not already familiar with REST API calls and Postman, I encourage you to check out the [Understanding API basics and the value they provide](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/understanding-api-basics-and-the-value-they-provide) blog on HPE Developer Community portal. It explains you REST API concepts such as HTTP verbs you call against the API, the headers, and payloads and how to use Postman to make API calls.  "

It is a **POST** operation against **/api/v2/session** to create a session object. The header specifies JSON as the exchange format and the body provides the user credentials and tenant name. The target HPE Container Platform endpoint (the gateway) IP address, the user credentials and tenant name are defined in a group of variables called a Postman *Environment*. These variables typically describe a given target environment and are expected to be set before the API calls. Postman also allows you to extract the session location from the response header and store it in a Postman environment variable for later use. This is accomplished by using a simple JavaScript code as shown in the *Tests* tab. "
