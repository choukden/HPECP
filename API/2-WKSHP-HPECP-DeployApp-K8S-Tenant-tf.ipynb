    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- HPE Container Platform deployment with a managed Kubernetes cluster\n",

    "- a Kubernetes tenant user account   \n",

    "- *HPE Container Platform* is an enterprise-grade container platform designed to deploy both cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications whether on-premises, at the edge, in multiple public clouds, or in a hybrid model. This makes the HPE Container Platform ideal for helping application developers and data scientists accelerate their application development and deployment on **containers**, on-demand through a self-service portal and a RESTful API that surfaces programmable access. To learn more about HPE Container Platform visit the [HPE DEV portal](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/hpe-container-platform/home) and check out the blog articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *tenant:* A tenant is a group of users created by the platform administrator. A tenant can represent for example, an office location, a business unit, an organization, a project, an application. A tenant is allocated a quota of resources (CPU/GPU, RAM, Storage, App Store images, Kubernetes cluster) by the platform administrator. All the resources used by a tenant are not shared with other tenants. A tenant user is granted the role of member or admin for the tenant.\n"

    "**Lab workflow:**\n",

    "In this lab part:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As tenant user you will first establish a valid login session with HPE CP using HPE CP REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You will then fetch the Kubeconfig file for your tenant working context using HPE CP REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, using a K8s API client such as **kubectl** you will deploy a simple cloud-native *stateless*, microservices applications, and a non-cloud-native distributed *stateful* AI/analytics **KubeDirector** application on **Kubernetes** cluster managed by HPE Container Platform. \n",

    "- *KubeDirector:* also known as Kubernetes Director, is a key component of HPE Container Platform. KubeDirector is an open source project initiated by HPE (BlueData) that enables the running of non-cloud-native stateful analytics workloads on Kubernetes. In HPE Container Platform, these applications generally refer to a distributed, single-node or multi-node application **virtual cluster**. Each application virtual cluster node runs as **a container** in the HPE Container Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Stateless application:* Stateless application is an application which does not require persistence of data and application state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Stateful application:* A stateful application typically requires persistence of certain mountpoints across application cluster nodes rescheduling, restarts, upgrades, rollbacks. A stateful application can also need persistence of network identity (i.e.: hostname). "
