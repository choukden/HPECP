    "3. Finally, using a K8s API client such as **kubectl** you will deploy a simple cloud-native *stateless*, microservices applications, and a non-cloud-native distributed *stateful* AI/analytics **KubeDirector** application on **Kubernetes** cluster managed by the HPE Container Platform. \n",

    "- *KubeDirector:* also known as Kubernetes Director, is a key component of HPE Container Platform. KubeDirector is an open source project initiated by HPE (BlueData) that enables the running of non-cloud-native stateful monolithic analytics workloads on Kubernetes. In HPE Container Platform, these applications generally refer to a distributed, single-node or multi-node application **virtual cluster**. Each application virtual cluster node runs as **a container** in the HPE Container Platform.\n",

    "- *Cloud-native application:* Also known as the 12 Factor app, a modern application that leverages microservices architecture with loosely coupled services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Non-cloud-native application:* a multi-tier application with tightly coupled and interdependent services. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Stateless application:* Stateless application is an application which does not require persistence of data and application state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Stateful application:* A stateful application typically requires persistence of certain mountpoints across application cluster nodes rescheduling, restarts, upgrades, rollbacks. A stateful application can also need persistence of network identity (i.e.: hostname). "
