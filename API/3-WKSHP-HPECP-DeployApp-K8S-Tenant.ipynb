    "- *HPE Container Platform* is an enterprise-grade container platform designed to deploy both cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications whether on-premises, at the edge, in multiple public clouds, or in a hybrid model. This makes the HPE Container Platform ideal for helping application developers and data scientists accelerate their application development and deployment on **containers**, on-demand through a self-service portal and a RESTful API that surfaces programmable access. To learn more about HPE Container Platform visit the [HPE DEV portal](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/hpe-container-platform/home) and check out the blog articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *tenant:* A tenant is a group of users created by the platform administrator. A tenant can represent for example, an office location, a business unit, an organization, a project, an application. A tenant is allocated a set of resources (CPU/GPU, RAM, Storage, App Store images, Kubernetes cluster) by the platform administrator. All the resources used by a tenant are not shared with other tenants. A tenant user is granted the role of member or admin for the tenant.\n"

Tenant users will then use kubectl to interact directly with the Kubernetes cluster in the context of their tenant.\n",

    "## The HPE Container Platform API Reference\n",
    "The HPE Container Platform REST API allows you to achieve multiple actions programmatically, from performing administrative tasks, deploying cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications to scoring trained Machine Learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can call the HPE Container Platform API, you need to know what calls can be placed. The REST API reference documentation describes each object type, along with the supported operations, request input parameters, response model and response codes. \n",
    "To access the REST API reference documentation, obtain the IP address or hostname of the current active HPE Container Platform controller host from the administrator of the platform. Then in a web browser, navigate to the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "http(s)://[Controller-IP-address-name]/apidocs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All the REST API calls are in the form: \n",
    "``` \n",
    "An HTTP VERB such as (GET , POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, UPDATE),  \n",
    "A target API object: http(s)://[Controller-IP-address]:8080/api/v2/[object]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Session Authentication in a multi-tenant environment\n",
    "With the exception of some API calls, most of the REST API calls you can do against the HPE Container Platform API requires authentication. HPE Container Platform uses a *‘session location’* to use as operation context. In a multi-tenant environment, you request an authentication session location by issuing an authentication request in the following form:\n",
    "* Call the API to request a new login session, providing username/password credentials as well as the Tenant name in the JSON body.  The user must be a valid tenant user credentials with a role (member or admin) in the requested tenant. \n",
    "* Extract the resource path of the created *session location* object from the JSON response header,\n",
    "* For each subsequent call, set a new HTTP Header with its key set to *X-BDS-SESSION* and its value set to the session location value and used as the *working tenant* context. \n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Note: the session location will expire after 24 hours. \n",
    "```   \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not already familiar with REST API calls, I encourage you to check-out the [Understanding API basics and the value they provide](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/understanding-api-basics-and-the-value-they-provide) blog on HPE Developer Community portal. It explains you REST API concepts such as HTTP verbs you call against the API, the headers, and payloads used when making API calls.  "
