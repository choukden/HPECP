    "### Description\n",
    "This coding challenge is a simple add-on to the Workshops-on-Demand: [**Introduction to the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform - REST API**](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshops). Here, you will be tasked with deploying a sample front-end application with a Web Interface on a CNCF certified Kubernetes cluster on HPE Ezmeral Container Platform using API calls. You can select a containerized application of your choice located in [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/). Part of this challenge includes answering questions on a quiz. Take this simple challenge to put what you have learned to the test and compete for prizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "This code challenge was created to reward collective learning. The evaluation criteria for this challenge are:\n",
    "* Completeness\n",
    "* Number of accurate responses to our quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission format\n",
    "You may submit **one** Kubernetes manifest YAML file for the deployment of your front-end application. The YAML file should have at least two declarative statements:\n",
    "* A **Deployment** that brings up one replica of your containerized application. The deployment should have a unique name in the form of **_YourAppName-YourFullName_**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **Service** that exposes your application as a network service via the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform. The service name should be unique in the form of **_YourAppName-Service-YourFullName_**. The service port name should be of type **_NodePort_** and it should be prefixed with **_http-_** in the service object definition. With this prefix, the application service will receive SSL termination at the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform gateway on a TCP service port higher than 10000.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### When you are ready to submit your response to the challenge, click [**here**](mailto:hpedev.hackshack@hpe.com?subject=HPE%20DEV%20Hack%20Shack%20Virtual%20Experience%20-%20container%20code%20challenge) to send it via e-mail to **HPE DEV Hack Shack team**. Your e-mail should include the following:\n",
    "* Your responses to the ****Quiz** **(copy/paste the challenge quiz section below along with your response in your e-mail)\n",
