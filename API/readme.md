Want to view the Jupyter Notebook online before downloading the file?
just click on the file HPECP-Intro-API.ipynb. GitHub will render the Jupyter Notebook for you.

If you want to run the Jupyter Notebook on your own Jupyter Notebook environment, download the .ipynb file as well as the images available in the Pictures folder. Adjust the HPE Container platform URI endpoint and username/password. Your Jupyter Notebook server will also need to have the Bash Kernel installed.
