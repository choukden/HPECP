    "### **Lab workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will first create your tenant user's working directory on the shared persistent container storage needed in the machine learning (ML) pipeline to store the dataset, trained models and scoring scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You will then build, train and test the model on a dataset using a remote tenant-shared training cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the Dataset\n",
    "The dataset is based on the 2019 New York City yellow cab trip data (approximately 375,000 trip records from January-June 2019). The dataset has many different properties (aka _\"X - features\"_) like the pickup time and location, the dropoff time and location, the trip distance, the number of passengers, and several other variables. The goal is to predict the taxi ride duration in NY City (the target aka _\"Y - label\"_) based on these features. For this workshop, you will be using a premade dataset that requires little preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the machine learning model algorithm\n",
    "Gradient boosting supervised machine learning algorithm with Python is used here to build the model that is capable of predicting the duration of taxi trips in New York city. Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost are used to build the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning workflow depicted in the diagram below follows the typical supervised machine learning workflow:\n",
    "- After loading the dataset, the ML algorithm separates data into features (the taxi ride properties) and label (the taxi ride duration). \n",
    "- Then the dataset is divided into two parts, one for training the model and one for testing the model. The typical split is 80/20.\n",
    "- The ML algorithm is then defined and the model is built with the training data set to learn from. \n",
    "- Once the model is trained, the ML algorithm tests the model by making predictions on the test data set with the test features. \n",
    "- Next, the model accuracy is evaluated by comparing the test predictions to the test labels. Error metrics such as RMSE are used to evaluate the predictions accuracy.\n",
    "- The trained model is finally saved to a file in the tenant user's working directory in the shared persistent container storage repository. The model is saved to a file so that it can be used in production to serve predictions.\n",
    "- The next step is then to move your trained model to production to serve your model as a prediction service (Lab Part 4) and make predictions on new data (Lab Part 5).\n",
