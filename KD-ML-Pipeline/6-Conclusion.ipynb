    "You have completed the steps to implement an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline, from data preparation to model deployment, using a CNCF-certified Kubernetes cluster managed by **HPE Ezmeral Container Platform (HPE ECP)** and another Open Source application called **KubeDirector**. You learned how to construct **dynamic** ML pipelines by chaining together multiple KubeDirector application clusters using the _Connections_ capability of KubeDirector. You explored how to use key elements of KubeDirector such as _KubeDirector Applications, KubeDirector Clusters and Connections_ to standarize the deployment of ML models on Kubernetes. The Open Source KubeDirector combined with Kubernetes cluster managed by HPE Ezmeral Container Platform allows data scientists to quickly spin up, **on-demand**, their development environments, develop their models, train their models against enterprise production data, and then push those models and the production code into a runtime to serve predictions."
